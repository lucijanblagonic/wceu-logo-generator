## Brand Guidelines [Coming soon]

* Dot size (small r=5, medium r=7, large r=9)
* Color options (90% opacity)

## Focus area specs

* Centered dot: r=28, 100% opacity (Location).
* Duplicated centered dot: r=9 (Location)
* 1st level neighbouring top/left/right/bottom dots: r=18 (Medium size)
* 2nd level neighbour dots (relative to 1st level): r=12 (Small size)

## TODO

* Focus area on dot click
* ~~Button downloads the logo as an SVG file (targets the SVG element)~~
* Link/update input values on change (type="color" and type="text")
* Add color randomize option

## Nice to have

* Create a unique link when styles are changed (similar to [colors.co](https://coolors.co/d7dedc-cfcfcd-9a879d-7a3b69-563440))
